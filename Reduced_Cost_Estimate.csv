Increased Cost Estimate,US East (N. Virginia),Lambda Functions for SNS and S3 media resizing,AWS Lambda,0,110,1320.00,USD,Number of requests (300000000)

The following modifications were made to the estimate:
App servers: smaller size EC2, 50% less instances
Web servers: smaller size EC2, 30% less instances
S3 : 30% less storage
Databse : 30% less storage

No changes were made components charged by volume of transactions such as API Gateway or S3 Data Transfer because the assumption is that customer base size remains the same, and therefore the application needs to handle the same amount of transactions.
